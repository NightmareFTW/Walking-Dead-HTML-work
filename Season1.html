      <p> Rick Grimes is the protagonist and a survivor of the outbreak in AMC's The Walking Dead. He is a former sheriff deputy who was shot in the line of duty and fell into a coma, only to awaken and find himself in the midst of the apocalypse. He travels to Atlanta, Georgia, in search of his wife, Lori, and his son, Carl, who have traveled to Atlanta with his best friend, Shane Walsh. After reuniting with his family, along with discovering a group of survivors, he gradually becomes the de-facto leader in their search of a safe haven. He's the current leader of the Alexandria Safe-Zone and one of the co-leaders of The Militia, the others being Maggie Rhee, Ezekiel and later Jadis.

As the series progresses, Rick gradually develops from an earnest, humble and moral individual into a hardened, ruthless and darker survivor. This nature places him into conflict with hostile forces seeking to exploit him for their own personal gain. Despite this, Rick holds a sworn devotion towards his group and will go towards great lengths to protect them from harm's way. </p>
