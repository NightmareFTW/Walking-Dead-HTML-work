        <img src="img/Sasha_Williams.jpg" title="Sasha Williams" alt="Sasha Williams" />

      <p> Sasha Williams is a main character and a survivor of the outbreak in AMC's The Walking Dead. A former firefighter before the apocalypse, Sasha belonged to a small group led by older brother Tyreese, trying to find a safe haven, and soon became one of the newcomers at the prison acting as a council member. After the downfall of the prison, she formed a relationship with fellow newcomer, Bob Stookey. After the deaths of Bob and Tyreese, she suffers from severe distress and PTSD, resulting in her isolating herself and refusing to invest in the community of Alexandria, believing its concept of trying to re-establish normal life to be false and an avoidance of the harsh reality of the apocalyptic world. Eventually, she comes to an acceptance of the community and wants to live and thrive following her grief. She forms a short but profound relationship with Abraham Ford in which she and the sergeant share common experience with PTSD and suicidal recklessness. Later on, Abraham is murdered by Negan, and Sasha takes Maggie to Hilltop and continued to reside there.</p>
